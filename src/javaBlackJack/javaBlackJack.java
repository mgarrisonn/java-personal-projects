//    # Command Line BlackJack
//
//    - Build a command line game of BlackJack in Java.
//    - Start with cards. Each card should have a face value and a suit.
//    - Next, build an array of 52 cards and store it as a variable called "deck".
//    - Add functionality for a user to play the computer.
//    - Rules of blackjack apply. The computer should follow dealer rules.
//    - See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack for more details.
//    - Make sure you shuffle the deck prior to play.
//    - Each player has a "hand" and that is updated every time they choose "HIT"
//    Hints
//      - Create a `javaBlackJack.javaBlackJack.Card` class.
//            - This class should have `face` and `suit` properties.
//      - Write a method named `getValue` that returns the blackjack value of the
//            card
//      - Create a `javaBlackJack.javaBlackJack.Hand` class that has cards in it. Create methods on this class to:
//            - calculate the value of a hand
//            - determine whether the hand is busted
//            - add a card to the hand
//      - Create a `Deck` class
//            - it should have a `cards` property that is a list of `javaBlackJack.javaBlackJack.Card` objects
//            - the deck should be initialzed when a new object is created (i.e. in the
//              constructor)
//            - it should have a `draw` method that removes a card
//            - it should have `shuffle` method that shuffles the deck
//      - Create a `Game` class that uses the other classes and contains the game logic
//      - Make sure to handle the case where aces can be 1 or 11
